`mcrt`: Exploring Mouse-Contingent Reading Times
================================================

If you just want to try it out, the demo is live at: http://davehowcroft.com/files/examples/word-mcr.html

Explanation copied from the demo
--------------------------------
This exercise was inspired by the work of Zarieß et al. (2015). They presented a whole-document, sentence-by-sentence approach to mouse-contingent reading. While the approach presented here does not yet include mouse-position tracking, it does provide word- or phrase-level text views, allowing in principle for finer grained reading time measures.

If you decide to develop this idea further, please let me know—I'd love to use your code! An acknowledgement might also be nice, if this is actually helpful :)

If you're modifying this for your own needs, I'd love it if you create a fork of this project and share your code under Apache 2 as well.

Ideally, I'd like to collect variations on this experimental design here so we can eventually run some comparisons between the designs and with self-paced reading (SPR) and eye-tracking (ET) data.
